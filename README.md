Attendance management is an essential record-keeping activity in any organization. The method of recording attendance is always manual, where the teacher/mentor calls our roll no or by name of the student & marks his/her attendance respectively. This becomes stressful at times and consumes a lot of time and energy. This method becomes more stressful when there are a large number of students present in a class or workspace. One more disadvantage is that there is also a chance of marking a fake or proxy attendance of students. In order to make it error-free and reduce the wastage of time, it is necessary to implement the Biometric Attendance System thus making it more efficient and effective. The design of this system is a collaboration of ESP32 (microcontroller), R307 Finger Print Module, 128x4 SSD1306 OLED Module, and an online Google Sheets integration. This system requires a connection to a website that can be gained through Wi-Fi. Under this type of process and working conditions, the device is now efficient in validating a person by his fingerprint and uploading the respective data with time in time.
